run_inference.py - Full SINGAPO inference pipeline

Takes demo_input.png + example_graph.json as input
Runs DINO feature extraction, diffusion inference (100 steps), mesh retrieval
Outputs object.json + PLY meshes to output/0/
run_visualizer.py - Interactive Viser-based 3D viewer

Loads articulated object meshes and displays them with distinct part colors
Direct drag interaction via transform gizmos on movable joints:
Revolute joints (doors): rotation gizmo constrained to joint axis
Prismatic joints (drawers): translation gizmo along joint axis
Click-to-select parts (highlights + shows info)
GUI panel: input image, part info, Reset/Animate/Export buttons
Animation mode: cyclic smooth motion of all joints
Tested and launches successfully with no errors
README.md - Complete user guide with setup, usage, controls, and troubleshooting




How to Run

conda activate 4yp
cd D:\4YP\singapo\Viser_trial

# Step 1: Generate 3D mesh from input image
python run_inference.py

# Step 2: Launch interactive viewer
python run_visualizer.py --object_dir output/0
# Then open http://localhost:8080 in browser
Quick Test (without running inference)
To verify the visualizer immediately using existing demo data:

python run_visualizer.py --object_dir ../demo/demo_output/0






# Full pipeline (inference + visualizer):
python run_whole.py --mode infer

# Visualize existing output only:
python run_whole.py --mode visualize --object_dir output/0

# Interactive mode (prompts you to choose):
python run_whole.py
